<P>There is other equipment that you will be able to attach to
the Spectrum. </P>
<P>The ZX Microdrive is a high speed mass storage device, and is
much more flexible in the way it can be used than a cassette
recorder. It will operate not only with SAVE, VERIFY, LOAD and
MERGE, but also with PRINT, LIST, INPUT and INKEY$. </P>
<P>The network is used for connecting several Spectrums so that
they can talk to each other - one of the uses of this is that you
then need only one Microdrive to serve several computers. </P>
<P>The RS232 interface is a standard connection that allows you
to link a Spectrum with keyboards, printers, computers and
various other machines even if they were not designed
specifically for the Spectrum. </P>
<P ALIGN="center">These will use some extra keywords that are on
the keyboard, but cannot be used without the extra attachments:
they are OPEN#, CLOSE#, MOVE, ERASE, CAT and FORMAT. </P>
