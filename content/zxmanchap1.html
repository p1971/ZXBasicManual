<H2>CHAPTER 1</H2>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>Whether you read the Introductory book first, or came straight
here, you should be aware that commands are obeyed straight away,
and instructions begin with a line number and are stored away for
later. You should also be aware of the commands: <B>PRINT</B>, <B>LET</B>,
and <B>INPUT</B> (which can be used on all machines that use
BASIC), and <B>BORDER</B>, <B>PAPER</B> and <B>BEEP</B> (which
are used on the Spectrum).</P>
<P>This BASIC manual starts by repeating some things given in the
introductory booklet, but in much more detail, telling you
exactly what you can and cannot do. You will also find some
exercises at the end of each chapter. Don't ignore these; many of
them illustrate points that are hinted at in the text. Look
through them, and do any that interest you, or that seem to cover
ground that you don't understand properly.</P>
<P>Whatever else you do, keep using the computer. If you have the
question &quot;what does it do if I tell it such and such?&quot;
then the answer is easy: type it in and see. Whenever the manual
tells you to type something in, always ask yourself, &quot;what
could I type instead?&quot;, and try out your replies. The more
of your own programs you write, the better you will understand
the computer.</P>
<P>At the end of this programming manual are some appendices.
These include sections on the way the memory is organised, how
the computer manipulates numbers, and a series of example
programs illustrating the power of the ZX Spectrum.</P>
<H4>The keyboard</H4>
<P>ZX Spectrum characters comprise not only the single symbols
(letters, digits, etc), but also the compound tokens (keywords,
function names, etc) and all these are entered from the keyboard
rather than being spelled out. To obtain all these functions and
commands, some keys have five or more distinct meanings, given
partly by shifting the keys (i.e. pressing either the <B>CAPS
SHIFT</B> key or the <B>SYMBOL SHIFT</B> key at the same time as
the required one) and partly by having the machine in different
modes. </P>
<P>The mode is indicated by the cursor, a flashing letter that
shows where the next character from the keyboard will be
inserted:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>K</B> (for keywords) mode automatically replaces <B>L</B>
mode when the machine is expecting a command or program
line (rather than <B>INPUT</B> data), and from its
position on the line it knows it should expect a line
number or a keyword. This is at the beginning of the
line, or just after <B>THEN</B>, or just after <B>:</B>
(except in a string). If unshifted, the next key will be
interpreted as either a keyword (written on the keys), or
a digit.</LI>
<LI><B>L</B> (for letters) mode normally occurs at all other
times. If unshifted, the next key will be interpreted as
the main symbol on that key, in lower case for letters.</LI>
<LI>In both <B>K</B> and <B>L</B> modes, <B>SYMBOL SHIFT</B>
and a key will be interpreted as the subsidiary red
character on the key and <B>CAPS SHIFT</B> with a digit
key will be interpreted as the control function written
in white above the key <B>CAPS SHIFT</B> with other keys
does not affect the keywords in <B>K</B> mode, and in <B>L</B>
mode it converts lower case to capitals.</LI>
<LI><B>C</B> (for capitals) mode is a variant of <B>L</B>
mode in which all letters appear as capitals. <B>CAPS
LOCK</B> causes a change from <B>L</B> mode to <B>C</B>
mode or back again.</LI>
<LI><B>E</B> (for extended) mode is used for obtaining
further characters, mostly tokens. It occurs after both
shift keys are pressed together, and lasts for one key
depression only. In this mode, a letter gives one
character or token (shown in green above it) if
unshifted, and another (shown in red below it) if pressed
with either shift. A digit key gives a token if pressed
with <B>SYMBOL SHIFT</B>; otherwise it gives a colour
control sequence.</LI>
<LI><B>G</B> (for graphics) mode occurs after <B>GRAPHICS</B>
(<B>CAPS SHIFT and 9</B>) is pressed, and lasts until it
is pressed again or 9 is pressed on its own. A digit key
will give a mosaic graphic, quit <B>GRAPHICS</B> or <B>DELETE</B>,
and each of the letter keys apart from V, W, X, Y and Z,
will give a user-defined graphic.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If any key is held down for more than about 2 or 3 seconds, it
will start auto-repeating.</P>
<P>Keyboard input appears in the bottom half of the screen as it
is typed, each character (single symbol or compound token) being
inserted just before the cursor. The cursor can be moved left
with <B>CAPS SHIFT</B> and <B>5</B>, or right with <B>CAPS SHIFT</B>
and <B>8</B>. The character before the cursor can be deleted with
<B>DELETE</B> (<B>CAPS SHIFT</B> and <B>9</B>). (Note: the whole
line can be deleted by typing <B>EDIT</B> (<B>CAPS SHIFT</B> and <B>1</B>)
followed by <B>ENTER</B>.)</P>
<P>When <B>ENTER</B> is pressed, the line is executed, entered
into the program, or used as <B>INPUT</B> data as appropriate,
unless it contains a syntax error. In this case a flashing <IMG SRC="inversequestionmark.gif" ALT="inverse question mark" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15"> appears next to the error.</P>
<P>As program lines are entered, a listing is displayed in the
top half of the screen. The last line entered is called the
current line and is indicated by the symbol <IMG SRC="inversegt.gif" ALT="&gt;" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15">; this can
be moved by using the keys <IMG SRC="crsrdown.gif" ALT="Cursor down" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"> (<B>CAPS SHIFT and 6</B>)
and <IMG SRC="crsrup.gif" ALT="Cursor up" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10">
(<B>CAPS SHIFT and 7</B>). If <B>EDIT</B> (<B>CAPS SHIFT and 1</B>)
is pressed, the current line is brought down to the bottom part
of the screen and can be edited.</P>
<P>When a command is executed or a program run, output is
displayed in the top half of the screen and remains until a
program line is entered, or ENTER is pressed with an empty line,
or <IMG SRC="crsrup.gif" ALT="Cursor up" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10">
or <IMG SRC="crsrdown.gif" ALT="Cursor down" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"> (CAPS SHIFT and 6) and <IMG SRC="crsrup.gif" ALT="Cursor up" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"> is pressed. In the bottom
part appears a report giving a code (digit or letter) referred to
in <A HREF="zxmanappb.html">Appendix B</A>. The report remains on
the screen until a key is pressed (and indicates <B>K</B> mode).</P>
<P>In certain circumstances, <B>CAPS SHIFT</B> with the <B>SPACE</B>
key acts as a <B>BREAK</B>, stopping the computer with report <B>D</B>
or <B>L</B>. This is recognised:</P>
<OL TYPE="i">
<LI>at the end of a statement while a program is running, or</LI>
<LI>while the computer is using the cassette recorder or
printer.</LI>
</OL>
<H4>The television screen</H4>
<P>This has 24 lines, each 32 characters long, and is divided
into two parts. The top part is at most 22 lines and displays
either a listing or program output. When printing in the top part
has reached the bottom, it all scrolls up one line; if this would
involve losing a line that you have not had a chance to see yet,
then the computer stops with the message <B>scroll?</B>. Pressing
the keys <B>N</B>, <B>SPACE</B> or <B>STOP</B> will make the
program stop with report <B>D BREAK - CONT repeats</B>; any other
key will let the scrolling continue. The bottom part is used for
inputting commands, program lines, and INPUT data, and also for
displaying reports. The bottom part starts off as two lines (the
upper one blank), but it expands to accommodate whatever is typed
in. When it reaches the current print position in the top half,
further expansions will make the top half scroll up.</P>
