<H4>Summary</H4>
<P>RANDOMIZE, RND </P>
<P>This chapter deals with the function RND and the keyword
RANDOMIZE. They are both used in connection with random numbers,
so you must be careful not to get them mixed up. They are both on
the same key (T); RANDOMIZE has had to be abbreviated to RAND.</P>
<P>In some ways RND is like a function: it does calculations and
produces a result. It is unusual in that it does not need an
argument.</P>
<P>Each time you use it, its result is a new random number
between 0 and 1. (Sometimes it can take the value 0, but never
1.)</P>
Try
<PRE><CODE><B>
          	10 PRINT RND
        	20 GO TO 10
</B></CODE></PRE>
<P>to see how the answer varies. Can you detect any pattern7 You
shouldn't be able to; 'random' means that there is no pattern.</P>
<P>Actually, RND is not truly random, because it follows a fixed
sequence of 65536 numbers. However, these are so thoroughly
jumbled up that there are at least no obvious patterns and we say
that RND is pseudo-random.</P>
<P>RND gives a random number between 0 and 1, but you can easily
get random numbers in other ranges. For instance, 5*RND is
between 0 and 5, and 1.3+0.7*RND is between 1.3 and 2. To get
whole numbers, use INT (remembering that INT always rounds down)
as in 1 +INT (RND*6), which we shall use in a program to simulate
dice. RND*6 is in the range 0 to 6, but since it never actually
reaches 6, INT (RND*6) is 0,1,2,3,4 or 5.</P>
<P>Here is the program:</P>
<PRE><CODE><B>
        	10 REM dice throwing program
        	20 CLS
        	30 FOR n=1 TO 2
        	40 PRINT 1+INT (RND*6);&quot; &quot;;
        	50 NEXT n
        	60 INPUT a$: GO TO 20
</B></CODE></PRE>
<P>Press ENTER each time you want to throw the dice.</P>
<P>The RANDOMIZE statement is used to make RND start off at a
definite place in its sequence of numbers, as you can see with
this program:</P>
<PRE><CODE><B>
        	10 RANDOMIZE 1
        	20 FOR n=1 TO 5: PRINT RND ,: NEXT n
        	30 PRINT: GO TO 10
</B></CODE></PRE>
<P>After each execution of RANDOMIZE 1, the RND sequence starts
off again with 0.0022735596. You can use other numbers between 1
and 65535 in the RANDOMIZE statement to start the RND sequence
off at different places.</P>
<P>If you had a program with RND in it and it also had some
mistakes that you had not found, then it would help to use
RANDOMIZE like this so that the program behaved the same way each
time you ran it.</P>
<P>RANDOMIZE on its own (and RANDOMIZE 0 has the same effect) is
different, because it really does randomize RND - you can see
this in the next program.</P>
<PRE><CODE><B>
        	10 RANDOMIZE
        	20 PRINT RND: GO TO 10
</B></CODE></PRE>
<P>The sequence you get here is not very random, because
RANDOMIZE uses the time since the computer was switched on. Since
this has gone up by the same amount each time RANDOMIZE is
executed, the next RND does more or less the same. You would get
better randomness by replacing GO TO 10 by GO TO 20.</P>
<P>Note: Most dialects of BASIC use RND and RANDOMIZE to produce
random numbers, but not all use them in the same way.</P>
<P>Here is a program to toss coins and count the numbers of heads
and tails.</P>
<PRE><CODE><B>
			10 LET heads=0: LET tails=0
			20 LET coin=INT (RND*2)
			30 IF coin=0 THEN LET heads=heads+1
			40 IF coin=1 THEN LET tails=tails+1
			50 PRINT heads;&quot;,&quot;;tails,
			60 IF tails&lt;&gt;0 THEN PRINT heads/tails;
			70 PRINT : GO TO 20
</B></CODE></PRE>
<P>The ratio of heads to tails should become approximately 1 if
you go on long enough, because in the long run you expect
approximately equal numbers of heads and tails.</P>
<P>Exercises</P>

<LI><PRE>Test this rule:
 Suppose you choose a number between 1 and 872 and type

        	RANDOMIZE your number

 Then the next value of RND will be

        	(75*(your number+1) -1) /65536

<LI>(For mathematicians only.)<BR>
<P>Let p be a (large) prime, and let a be a primitive
root modulo p. </P>
<P>Then if b<SUB>i</SUB> is the residue of a<SUB>i</SUB>
modulo p (1 &#x2264; b<SUB>i</SUB>
&#x2264; p-l ), the sequence</P>
<P><IMG SRC="chap11diag1.gif" ALT="b subscript i minus 1 over p minus 1" WIDTH="57" HEIGHT="90"> </P>
<P>is a cyclical sequence of p-1 distinct numbers in the
range 0 to 1 (excluding 1). By choosing a suitably, these
can be made to look fairly random.</P>
<P>65537 is a Fermat prime, 2<SUP>16</SUP>+1. Because the
multiplicative group of non-zero residues modulo 65537
has a power of 2 as its order, a residue is a primitive
root if and only if it is not a quadratic residue. Use
Gauss' law of quadratic reciprocity to show that 75 is a
primitive root modulo 65537.</P>
<P>The ZX Spectrum uses p=65537 and a=75, and stores some
b<SUB>i</SUB>-1 in memory. RND entails replacing b<SUB>i</SUB>-1
in memory by b<SUB>i+1</SUB> -1, and yielding the result
(b<SUB>i+1</SUB>-l) (p-l). RANDOMIZE n (with 1&#x2264;n&#x2264;65535) makes
b<SUB>i</SUB> equal to n+1.</P>
<P>RND is approximately uniformly distributed over the
range 0 to 1.</P>
