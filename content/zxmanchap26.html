<H3>Using machine code</H3>
<H4>Summary</H4>
<P>USR with numeric argument </P>
<P>This chapter is written for those who understand Z80 machine
code, the set of instructions that the Z80 processor chip uses.
If you do not, but would like to, there are plenty of books about
it. You want to get one called something along the lines of
&quot;Z80 Machine code [or assembly language] for the absolute
beginner&quot;, and if it mentions the Spectrum, so much the
better.</P>
<P>These programs are normally written in assembly language,
which, although cryptic, are not too difficult to understand with
practice. (You can see the assembly language instructions in
Appendix A.) However, to run them on the computer you need to
code the program into a sequence of bytes in this form it is
called machine code. This translation is usually done by the
computer itself, using a program called an assembler. There is no
assembler built in to the Spectrum, but you may well be able to
buy one on cassette. Failing that, you will have to do the
translation yourself, provided that the program is not too long. </P>
<P>Let's take as an example the program </P>
<PRE><CODE><B>
	ld bc, 99 
	ret
</B></CODE></PRE>
<P>which loads the bc register pair with 99. This translates into
the four machine code bytes 1, 99, 0 (for ld bc, 99) and 201 (for
ret). (If you look up 1 and 201 in Appendix A, you will find ld
bc, NN - where NN stands for any two byte number - and ret.) </P>
<P>When you have got your machine code program, the next step is
to get it into the computer. (An assembler would probably do this
automatically.) You need to decide whereabouts in memory to put
it, and the best thing is to make extra space for it between the
BASIC area and the user defined graphics. </P>
<P>Suppose, for instance, that you have a 16K Spectrum. To start
off with, the top end of RAM has </P>
<P>If you type </P>
<PRE><CODE><B>
       	CLEAR 32499
</B></CODE></PRE>
<P>this will give you a space of 100 (for good measure) bytes
starting at address 32500. </P>
<P>To put in the machine code program, you would run a BASIC
program something like </P>
<PRE><CODE><B>
		10 LET a=32500
		20 READ n: POKE a,n
		30 LET a=a+1:GOTO 20
		40 DATA 1,99,0,201
</B></CODE></PRE>
<P>(This will stop with report E Out of DATA when it has filled
in the four bytes you specified.) </P>
<P>To run the machine code, you use the function USR but this
time with a numeric argument, the starting address. Its result is
the value of the bc register on return from the machine code
program, so if you do </P>
<PRE><CODE><B>
     	PRINT USR 32500
</B></CODE></PRE>
<P>you get the answer 99. </P>
<P>The return address to the BASIC is stacked in the usual way,
so return is by a Z80 ret instruction. You should not use the iy
and i registers in a machine code routine. </P>
<P>You can save your machine code program easily enough with </P>
<PRE><CODE><B>
     	SAVE &quot;some name&quot; CODE 32500,4
</B></CODE></PRE>
<P>On the face of it, there is no way of saving it so that when
loaded it automatically runs itself, but you can get round this
by using a BASIC program. </P>
<PRE><CODE><B>
     	10 LOAD &quot;&quot; CODE 32500,4
     	20 PRINT USR 32500
</B></CODE></PRE>
<P>Do first </P>
<PRE><CODE><B>
       	SAVE &quot;some name&quot; LINE
</B></CODE></PRE>
<P>and then </P>
<PRE><CODE><B>
       	SAVE &quot;xxxx&quot; CODE 32500,4
       	LOAD &quot;some name&quot;
</B></CODE></PRE>
<P ALIGN="center">will then load and automatically run the BASIC
program, and the BASIC program will load and run the machine
code. </P>
