<H2>APPENDIX B</H2>
<H3>Reports</H3>
<P>These appear at the bottom of the screen whenever the computer
stops executing some BASIC, and explain why it stopped, whether
for a natural reason, or because an error occurred.</P>
<P>The report has a code number or letter so that you can refer
to the table here, a brief message explaining what happened and
the line number and statement number within that line where it
stopped. (A command is shown as line 0. Within a line, statement
1 is at the beginning, statement 2 comes after the first colon or
THEN, and so on.) </P>
<P>The behaviour of CONTINUE depends very much on the reports.
Normally, CONTINUE goes to the line and statement specified in
the last report, but there are exceptions with reports 0, 9 and D
(also see Appendix C). </P>
<P>Here is a table showing all the reports. It also tells you in
what circumstances the report can occur, and this refers you to
Appendix C. For instance error A Invalid argument can occur with
SQR, IN, ACS and ASN and the entries for these in Appendix C tell
you exactly what arguments are invalid.</P>

<TD>Meaning</TD>

</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="top">0</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">0K</TD>
<TD>Any<BR>
Successful completion, or jump to a line number bigger
than any existing. This report does not change the line
and statement jumped to by CONTINUE. </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="top">1</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">NEXT without FOR</TD>
<TD>NEXT<BR>
The control variable does not exist (it has not been set
up by a FOR statement), but there is an ordinary variable
with the same name. </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="top">2</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">Variable not found</TD>
<TD>Any<BR>
For a simple variable this will happen if the variable is
used before it has been assigned to in a LET, READ or
INPUT statement or loaded from tape or set up in a FOR
statement. For a subscripted variable it will happen if
the variable is used before it has been dimensioned in a
DIM statement or loaded from tape. </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="top">3</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">Subscript wrong</TD>
<TD>Subscripted variables, Substrings<BR>
A subscript is beyond the dimension of the array, or
there are the wrong number of subscripts. If the
subscript is negative or bigger than 65535, then error B
will result. </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="top">4</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">Out of memory</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">LET, INPUT, FOR, DIM, GO SUB, LOAD,
MERGE.<BR>
Sometimes during expression evaluation. There is not
enough room in the computer for what you are trying to
do. If the computer really seems to be stuck in this
state, you may have to clear out the command line using
DELETE and then delete a program line or two (with the
intention of putting them back afterwards) to give
yourself room to manoeuvre with - say - CLEAR. </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="top">5</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">Out of screen</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">INPUT, PRINT AT<BR>
An INPUT statement has tried to generate more than 23
lines in the lower half of the screen. Also occurs with
PRINT AT 22, . . . </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="top">6</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">Number too big</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">Any arithmetic<BR>
Calculations have led to a number greater than about
1038. </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="top">7</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">RETURN without GO SUB</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">RETURN<BR>
There has been one more RETURN than there were GO SUBs. </TD>

<TD VALIGN="top">9</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">STOP statement</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">STOP<BR>
After this, CONTINUE will not repeat the STOP, but
carries on with the statement after. </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="top">A</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">Invalid argument</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">SQR, LN, ASN, ACS, USR (with string
argument)<BR>
The argument for a function is no good for some reason. </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="top">B</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">Integer out of range</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">RUN, RANDOMIZE, POKE, DIM, GO TO, GO
SUB, LIST, LLIST, PAUSE, PLOT, CHR$, PEEK, USR (with
numeric argument), Array access<BR>
When an integer is required, the floating point argument
is rounded to the nearest integer. If this is outside a
suitable range then error B results. For array access,
see also Error 3. </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="top">C</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">Nonsense in BASIC</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">VAL, VAL$<BR>
The text of the (string) argument does not form a valid
expression. </TD>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="top">D</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">BREAK - CONT repeats</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">LOAD, SAVE, VERIFY, MERGE, LPRINT,
LLIST, COPY.<BR>
Also when the computer asks scroll? and you type N, SPACE
or STOP. BREAK was pressed during some peripheral
operation. The behaviour of CONTINUE after this report is
normal in that it repeats the statement. Compare with
report L. </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="top">E</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">Out of DATA</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">READ<BR>
You have tried to READ past the end of the DATA list. </TD>

There is not enough room left in memory to accommodate
the new program line. </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="top">H</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">STOP in INPUT</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">INPUT<BR>
Some INPUT data started with STOP, or - for INPUT LINE -
was pressed. Unlike the case with report 9, after report
H CONTINUE will behave normally, by repeating the INPUT
statement. </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="top">I</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">FOR without NEXT</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">FOR<BR>
There was a FOR loop to be executed no times (e.g. FOR n=
1 TO 0) and the corresponding NEXT statement could not be
found. </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="top">J</TD>

The number specified is not an appropriate value. </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="top">L</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">BREAK into program</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">Any<BR>
BREAK pressed, this is detected between two statements.
The line and statement number in the report refer to the
statement before BREAK was pressed, but CONTINUE goes to
the statement after (allowing for any jumps to be done),
so it does not repeat any statements. </TD>

<TD VALIGN="top">M</TD>
<TD VALIGN="top">RAMTOP no good</TD>
